# Compiler integration checkpoint

This file retains the current compiler handoff and unresolved verification work.
Completed execution logs, previous checkpoints and review transcripts live in
Git history. Architecture and library contracts belong in [LIBRARIES.md](LIBRARIES.md),
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Current checkpoint: portable native sockets

Header-backed bindings now support typed integer constants, optional macro
fallbacks and `c.record` with header-owned layout and scalar type assertions.
`std.net` uses native constants and `addrinfo`, signed I/O counts, close-on-exec
and SIGPIPE protection. Connection and cleanup logic remain Zen. See DESIGN.md
and the native-binding/native-socket library fixtures for contracts and limits.

The macOS integration on this branch regenerated the seed and passed the
194-unit/seed fixpoint. Native checks passed: 13 binding contracts, 13 existing
binding tests and IPv4/IPv6 socket/allocator-failure checks under UBSan. Grammar
accepted 1,373 valid files and rejected all 24 invalid fixtures. The final
`make -j1 seed verify` corpus result was 1,344 passed, 10 failed, 1 deferred.
It stopped at the corpus, so later aggregate gates are not claimed complete.
The Linux socket run passed 1,354 corpus cases with one deferred case, native
networking and actor/allocator checks. Merge preparation then removed unused
arithmetic helpers, fixed warning regressions and made scalar ABI assertions
C99-compatible. Final compiler fixpoint and focused runtime checks pass locally.
CI now installs the pinned review-tool dependency from tests/requirements.txt;
full verification of the prepared PRs #3–#5 is pending.

`std.math` owns scalar f64 mathematics. `std.stats` owns caller-allocated bounded
rolling samples and nearest-rank summaries. Focused numerical, allocation-budget
and negative-control tests passed. The stats addition used the existing compiler;
no later compiler rebuild or seed regeneration is claimed.

The native application libraries and app are separate sibling repositories.
Their setup, threading contracts and measured performance are documented there,
with shared ownership boundaries in [LIBRARIES.md](LIBRARIES.md).

`std.net.readiness` now provides caller-allocated, level-triggered kqueue/epoll
readiness with explicit EINTR and native-error results. Focused UBSan checks
and the negative slot control pass on macOS and Linux. Full aggregate
verification remains pending. Actor mailbox scheduling is unchanged. See
[READINESS.md](READINESS.md) for ownership and platform semantics.

## Unfinished work

- Preserve the paused opaque-type draft in the separate primary checkout.
  It was not included in this native-socket branch. Also preserve the unrelated
  local `grammar/src/tree_sitter/array.h` drift; it is not part of this change.
- Resolve the remaining macOS corpus failures: Linux-specific backend/path
  expectations, `/proc` fixture, Clang nesting limits and TLS linking. Check
  Linux CI before claiming portability verified on both operating systems.
- Linux warning checks now pass at GCC315 and Clang320 for the seed, with the
  Clang budget lowered after removing 24 unused arithmetic helpers. The later
  review-tool dependency failure is fixed in the workflow; confirm the full CI
  rerun before merging. No warning class or test gate was disabled.
- The historical 92-case soundness hunt still needs its original inputs and
  case-by-case classification. Parser memoization alone does not prove linear
  scaling for all incomplete nested inputs.
- Automatic header import, SIMD lowering and package resolution remain future
  capabilities. Consult [ERGONOMICS_PLAN.md](ERGONOMICS_PLAN.md) and
  [ISSUES.md](../ISSUES.md) before choosing a compiler change.

## Integration rules

Preserve uncommitted work and assign disjoint file ownership. Use isolated
`make dev-check DEV_DIR=build/dev/<lane> FILTER=<id> TEST_ARGS=--no-result-cache`
lanes for compiler work. Correctness changes need executable regressions and
negative controls; never suppress a diagnostic or skip a gate to obtain green.

Run `make -j1 seed verify` once at compiler integration, then inspect
`git diff --check` and `git status --short`. Report incomplete checks explicitly.
Update this checkpoint with the current state, not an accumulating session log.
